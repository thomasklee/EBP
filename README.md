## Archive of course materials for Evidence-Based Practice in Speech-Language Therapy

This repository contains lectures and handouts from an undergraduate course at The University of Hong Kong (SHSC 2033). The materials are from the course taught in 2019 by Professor Thomas Klee and Dr Elizabeth Barrett.

The repository is organised by folder, with each containing slide presentations in PDF format along with the source files (LaTeX, references, images) on which they are based. The `Lectures` folder contains folders for each of the 11 class sessions, with an additional folder containing the course syllabus. The course was delivered in 11 weekly sessions -- each lasting 3 hours -- and was assessed with two written assignments. Most sessions consisted of a lecture followed by small group discussions, where students critically appraised published clinical research studies.
