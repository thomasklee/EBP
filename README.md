## Evidence-Based Practice in Speech-Language Therapy: course archive

This repository contains lectures and handouts from an undergraduate course at The University of Hong Kong (SHSC 2033). The materials are from the course taught by Professor Thomas Klee and Dr Elizabeth Barrett in 2019. 

The repository is organised by folder, with each containing slide presentations in PDF format along with the source files (LaTeX, references, images) on which they are based. The `Lectures` folder contains separate folders for each of 11 class sessions, with an additional folder for the `Course syllabus`. The course was delivered in weekly sessions -- each lasting 3 hours -- and was assessed with two written assignments. Most sessions consisted of a lecture followed by small group discussions, where students critically appraised published clinical research studies and orally reported their findings to the full class.

The course in its present form represents an evolution of the course first developed and taught at Newcastle University (UK) in 2006 by Helen Stringer, David Howard and me. That first course, half the length of the current one, is described in an aricle by the same authors that appeared in a special issue of the journal, _Evidence-Based Communication Assessment and Intervention,_ on teaching EBP:
