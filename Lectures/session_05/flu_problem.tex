\textbf{Medical experts refute singers' claims of flu vaccine risks}
\\
\vspace{3mm}
\footnotesize{``Cantopop singers have recently made warnings against flu vaccines. In a leaked WhatsApp audio recording, Ms Kay Tse On-kei said flu vaccines contained mutated bacteria and mercury. [Her] claims were rejected by HKU microbiologist Professor Yuen Kwok-Yung. Dr Ho Pak Leung, Director of the HKU Centre for Infection, \dots emphasized that medical issues should be separated from entertainment. HKU Dean of Medicine Professor Gabriel Leung said these comments made by well-known figures had no support from the scientific and medical fields. \\
\vspace{3mm}
HKU released findings of a study on the effectiveness of the vaccine type for the current flu season. It found that the flu jabs were 66\% effective. The study looked into the data of 1,078 children who were admitted to hospitals between December 4 last year and January 31 this year. All the children suffered from fever and acute respiratory illness. Among the 339 confirmed with flu, only 22 had been vaccinated. Of the remaining 739 children who were unaffected by the virus, 103 had received seasonal flu vaccinations. (Major local papers)"}

\begin{frame}{Threats to external validity?}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Retrospective study
	\item Was determination of who received flu vaccine based on medical records or self-report?
	\item Data based on hospitalisations only (those with severe symptoms?) so odds ratio may not reflect wider population.
	\item People who didn't get ill (who received and didn't receive the vaccine) weren't included.
	\item Press release indicates study participants were children, so results cannot be generalised to adults.
